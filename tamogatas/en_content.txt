title:Donate financially!
content:
We are grateful for any funds donated. It is very important to write Donation at the Purpose of Payment or Message field. You can trace the use of monetary donations at Transparency/Donations menu item at the bottom. From these funds we purchase field-equipment (like camera traps) and finance the daily running of the Foundation (electricity, heating, accountant).

title:Donate equipment!
content:
Primarily we need items used during fieldwork. However, if you have surplus functional A3-page scanner, printer, PC, laptop, loudspeakers, desk-lamp, think of us! In the field, we need camera traps (trail cameras), flashlights, headlamps, batteries, entomologist equipment, scoop-nets, canoe, paddles, drones…and more.
