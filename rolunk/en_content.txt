Our predecessor, the Foundation for the World Heritage of Children had the mission to entrust the remaining wild places to the next generations. The young guardians would build up an eco-conscious and responsible society and connect the small preserved natural areas into a more extensive protected wild land.
The renewed Foundation pursues the same original goals, but with different accents: connecting as many preserved and rewilded areas as possible has become the main target.
